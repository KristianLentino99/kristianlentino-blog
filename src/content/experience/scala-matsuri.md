## My first public talk ever at Scala Matsuri 2024 in Tokyo

I had the chance to be part of this edition of Scala Matsuri in Tokyo, Japan.
It was an amazing experience to talk about my journey from a PHP developer to a Scala developer. I talked about the difficulties, the time I spent reading documentation and books to become familiar with the new technology. I also talked about the benefits of using Functional Programming concepts to write more robust and maintainable code.
