**From:** September 2018 <br>
**To:** March 2019

I started my career as a software engineer at Zucchetti S.p.A. in September 2018 as one of the first employees to attend the new academy of the company.

I was part of the development team of one of the main products of the company, the software for the management of the security at work. I've worked with a team of 10 people, including developers, testers, and project managers.
