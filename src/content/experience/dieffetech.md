**From:** March 2019 <br>
**To:** April 2022

My main tasks were focused on creating from scratch new systems for our clients, both on FE and BE sides. Also, a frequent part of my job was designing APIs for mobile devices and third-party systems which integrate with ours. I've worked on a lot of different types of projects, below is a quick list:

- Food delivery apps
- Custom E-learning systems for our clients
- Automatic electronic invoices systems
- Job search systems
- E-commerce and news websites
- Corporate websites

My main stack was PHP, CSS, and JS with Jquery. I've integrated our systems with a lot of third-party providers like:

- Stripe
- Paypal
- Aruba
- Acube
- Google
- and many others...
