**From:** April 2022 <br>
**To:** May 2024


I was part of the Share Investing team, which focused on enabling customers to buy and sell instruments such as stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and bonds. Previously, I spent over a year and a half in the Customer Experience (CX) team, where we were responsible for enhancing and developing new features with a strong customer focus, always aiming to provide the best possible experience. The CX team also handled user onboarding, a critical aspect of our service.


## Some highlights

### Give value to your hobbies
During our 2023's offsite I had the chance to talk about my hobbies. So I've decided to talk about Anime&Manga but from a business perspective. I brought in this presentation the numbers behind this amazing market which is constantly growing in all the world.

### My first internal talk
This is a picture of me during my first internal talk at Moneyfarm. I was talking about my journey from a PHP developer to a Scala developer. I talked about the difficulties, the time I spent reading documentation and books to become familiar with the new technology. I also talked about the benefits of using Functional Programming concepts to write more robust and maintainable code.
